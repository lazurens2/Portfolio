# Welcome

Hello and Welcome ! My name is Mohamed Jelidi and I am super-glad that you are reading this!

Professionally, I am a Data Scientist, Business Intelligence and Bid Data Analytics Practioner with over three years of experience in several industries.

I leverage Big Data to drive business strategy, revamp customer experience and revolutionize existing operational processes.

In contrast, I have learned alot from the community, and I present some of what I have got in my public repohere. My intention is to keep this alive by feeding more examples and case studies from time time but no clear plans or frequencies.

To sum up, I am absolutely and utterly passionate about Data Science and I am looking forward to sharing my passion and knowledge with you!

# [Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling with Python Training Course - Level 1](https://github.com/lazurens2/Portfolio/tree/master/Machine%20Learning%20and%20Predictive%20Modeling%20with%20Python%20Training%20Course%20-%20Level%201/Level%201)

I think Python is an amazing platform for machine learning. There are so much power ready to use.

## “How Machine Learning with python looks like and what is the skillset needed to do predictive modeling that actually works for real world scenarios ?”

This Course is my definitive answer to that question, that I myself thought about it in the past and get to hustling to get useful answers.
It contains my very best knowledge and ideas on how to work through predictive modeling machine learning projects using the Python ecosystem.
It is the course that I am also going to use as a refresher before starting any new projects.

I’m really glad and proud of this course and I hope that you find it a useful companion on your machine learning journey as well.

This is a training course that I designed contains a full package of python scripts in the context of Predictive Modeling with Python. Starting from learning the syntax, up until using the famous Machine Learning Library `scikit learn` to create supervised models. The data used could be found publicly online (and yes it is shared here, every example is ).
Subjects covered in the training course folder : 
- Preprocessing
- Regression
- Classification
- TimeSeries Forecasting
- Supplementary materials
