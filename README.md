# Welcome

Hello and Welcome ! My name is Mohamed Jelidi and I am super-glad that you are reading this!

Professionally, I am a Data Scientist, Business Intelligence and Bid Data Analytics Practioner with over three years of experience in several industries.

I leverage Big Data to drive business strategy, revamp customer experience and revolutionize existing operational processes.

In contrast, I have learned alot from the community, and I present some of what I have got in my public repository here on github. My intention is to keep this alive by feeding occasionally more examples and case studies from time time but no strict plans or frequencies.

To sum up, I am absolutely and utterly passionate about Data Science and I am looking forward to sharing my passion and knowledge with you!

# OnGoing Projects
* **Business Intelligence Using Qlik Sense For Data Discovery and Visualization : **
This project, aims at publishing small projects of Qlik Sense applications that would demonstrate some Business Intelligence skills and key competencies, such as, Data Modeling, Set Analysis and Data Visualisation .. All that applied in very interesting industries Like Retail, Insurance, Finance, Humain Resource, Customer Relationsip Management, and much more...

* **Data Analytics For Predictive Modeling:**

Define my process to design predictive modeling experiments, based on data comprehension and analysis.

Create Dashboards that assist the Data Scientist to identify Predictable variables, supported with clear and concise explanations. Design predictive experiments and create models Integrate the output of predictive models into the analytics layers (Dashboards of Analytical Apps) 

* **My Portfolio:**
My portfolio project is designed to demonstrate skills I have developed few years ago in Machine Learning and Deep Learning with real life use cases and scenarios that are valuable to several industries.
I learn incrementally, leveraging work from prior projects on larger and more challenging future projects.

The portfolio also will employers to confirm capability to deliver stable results, skillful predictions and useful analytics.

My approach to design the portfolio :

- Problem Type: There are a wide range of problem types that predictive analytics could present promising results and deliver useful insights, myself I prefer working single mindedly and single-handly on what could be of a maximum value to the end user in some popular indistries, such Banking, Insurance and Retail but not limited to these ...

- Data : I will be either generating my data myself for sake of simplicity, or will be using public dataset available online.

As this project is not a project created to go on production, I will pay much attention to respect best practices but the code here will certainly be of a small scope with data that can fit a Laptop Memory, and fitting that could be performed on a Simple CPU or GPU as well.

# [Dashboard Study Revealings (DSR) Methodology](https://github.com/lazurens2/Portfolio/wiki/Dashboard-Study-Revealings-(DSR)-Methodology)

I designed a Method to shape and clarify the process of **Predctive Modeling**, I called it **DSR+P**

* D : Dashboard
* S : Study
* R : Revealings
* P : Present

![DSR+P](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48279474/54601874-6edf4880-4a40-11e9-9d92-485ca34e82ec.png)

The Dashboard, Study, Revealings and Presentation (DSR+P) methodology is a foundation you can build all of your applications on while still having room to be creative and learn the different areas of the data. In a nutshell you lead with a Dashboard page, followed by Study pages, and finish with Revealings pages. The system works on a few levels but to understand some of why it works we have to discuss how people interact with computers and how we perceive information.

# [Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling with Python Training Course - Level 1](https://github.com/lazurens2/Portfolio/tree/master/Machine%20Learning%20and%20Predictive%20Modeling%20with%20Python%20Training%20Course%20-%20Level%201/Level%201)

I think Python is an amazing platform for machine learning. There are so much power ready to use.

## “How Machine Learning with python looks like and what is the skillset needed to do predictive modeling that actually works for real world scenarios ?”

This Course is my definitive answer to that question, that I myself thought about it in the past and get to hustling to get useful answers.
It contains my very best knowledge and ideas on how to work through predictive modeling machine learning projects using the Python ecosystem.
It is the course that I am also going to use as a refresher before starting any new projects.

I’m really glad and proud of this course and I hope that you find it a useful companion on your machine learning journey as well.

This is a training course that I designed contains a full package of python scripts in the context of Predictive Modeling with Python. Starting from learning the syntax, up until using the famous Machine Learning Library `scikit learn` to create supervised models. The data used could be found publicly online (and yes it is shared here, every example is ).
Subjects covered in the training course folder : 
- Preprocessing
- Regression
- Classification
- TimeSeries Forecasting
- Supplementary materials

## License
In my opinion, there are three main options when choosing a License : 
- A: I give you source code, you don't give back your changes (BSD)
- B: I give you source code, you give back your changes (GNU GPL V2)
- C: I give you source code, you can't use your changes on your devices only if you follow my rules. (GNU GPL V3)

The **C** option is going to violate the freedom of anyone who wants to contribute, which is something I don't like very much about this type of Licensing in the space of Opensource.

My argument about **B** is the type of Licensing that I am comfortable with, and Linux is GPL V2, so I believe being an active contributor would be beneficial to everyone and can create a space of positive virality.

The **A** option expects passive usage, which is not the best option if we chose to improve.

GNU GPL V2 : Linus Torvalds said "I give you source code, you give me your changes back, We are even."
It's as simple as that, I just don't want to violate the freedom of anyone who wants to use my contributions. I just expect from guys that
