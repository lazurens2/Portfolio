# Welcome
Hello, and welcome. My name is Mohamed I am a Data Scientist, Business Intelligence and Bid Data Analytics Practioner with some years of experience. Even I have seen so many interesting things in real world projects, reading a lot of books and testing infinite lines of code. I still feel like I don't know anything and still have to learn MORE and MORE.

In contrast, I have learned alot from the community, and I present some of what I have got in my public repohere. My intention is to keep this alive by feeding more examples and case studies from time time but no clear plans or frequencies.
